# Machine Learning Project - CO3117

## 📌 Overview
This is a group assignment for the Machine Learning course (CO3117), Semester 1, Academic Year 2025-2026.  
The project applies machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## 🚀 How to Run
### Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Open Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- Run the notebooks in order:
- notebooks/exploration.ipynb → Data exploration and preprocessing
- notebooks/modeling.ipynb → Model training and evaluation
